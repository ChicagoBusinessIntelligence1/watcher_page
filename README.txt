Stream readme
*************

You can easily edit the appearance of your page by using the page designer. (Settings -> Edit settings... -> Stream -> Page designer...)

If you need more control over the page you can edit the HTML of the page your self by editing the template files: 

template_js.html (used by JavaScript) 
template_ja.html (used by Java Applet)
template_wm.html (used by Windows Media) 


It is also possilbe to use a webserver of your own and skip the build in one. Look at the html code in the file own_server_example.html to see an example of how the code on your page could look like. Note that this example uses the Java Applet and not the JavaScript. Another JavaScript example will come later...
